# Power_Spectrum_in_presence_of_flagging
Estimation of power spectrum in presence of RFI flagging or no-uniform data set

The py files uses LSSA and CLEAN algorithm to deal with random and periodic flagging and estimate the power spectrum. 
Single_baseline py file demonstrates the algorithms with just a random single baseline. 
First try this out and then proceed to do the similar work with the whole data set.
